        <div class="desc-artist">One of the most famous Filipino sculptors, Napoleon Veloso Abueva, was one of the youngest recipients of the National Artist for Sculpture title in the year 1976. Among other things, Abueva is known as the Father of Modern Philippine Sculpture. He is credited for shaping the art of sculpture in his country. Abueva used numerous types of material to create sculpture masterpieces including marble, bronze, iron, stainless steel, hard wood, cement, adobe, coral and alabaster. Among one of his early innovation in his field was “buoyant sculpture”, which according to him was something to be viewed from the surface of a pool. He is famously known for being the first Filipino artist for putting up a one-man sculptural exhibit in the Philippine Center in New York in the year 1980. He was awarded the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Philippines Award (TOYM) in 1959 and the ASEAN Award for Visual Arts in the year 1987.

        <div class="desc-left">It is a bronze-copper statue surrounded by lights behind it, that when it turns the lights on, it gives the appearance of a radiant and gloriously shining sun that shines above the visitors of the hotel, giving it not only a creative flair, but an air of nobility as the people gaze upon the piece. It is 12 meters long in diameter. The statue is of a beautiful sun, with details adorned in almost every section of the piece. From the center of sun, to the rays that stretch outward, and even the dull but yet elegant marble background add to the art’s complexity and beauty. The core of the sun appears to have patterns that mimic the appearance of solar flares, with arcs stretched across borders of the sun, and the shapes appearing to have outstretched from the main structure give it a much more defined texture.
