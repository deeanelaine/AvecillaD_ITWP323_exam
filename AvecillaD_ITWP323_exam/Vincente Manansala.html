        <div class="desc-artist">Vicente Manansala was a prodigious artist who received a six-month grant from UNESCO and was invited to study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Quebec, Canada. He is most commonly known for his Cubist paintings, prints and illustration. He was a member of the Thirteen Moderns, which was led by Victorio Edades. As a neo-realist, he became one of the few artists who were responsible for the modernist movement in the country. Primarily, his work was focused on the issues and the problems of the world. Along with this, the Second World War had a great impact on his paintings. National culture, social environment, identity and native sensibility became the epicenter of his works. Along with this, he also worked on some abstract pieces but his main focus remained on using art as a social commentary. Manansala held his first solo exhibition in the year 1951 at the Manila Hotel. His work had an immense influence on the next generation of painters which included Manuel Baldemor and Angelito Antonio. The Honolulu Museum of Art, the Lopez Memorial Museum, Manila and the Philippine Center in New York hold some of his most famous works. He was posthumously awarded the Order of National Artists of the Philippines in Visual Arts (Painting) in the year 1981.

        <div class="desc-left">The Bird Seller (Lot 2135) by master modernist Vicente Manansala is an iconic work, contributing significantly towards the visual development of cubism in Asia. Painted in 1976, when Manansala had gained full mastery over his definitive style of "Translucent Cubism", it holds a place amongst some of the finest compositions of Manansala's career along with the other works of its ilk - localised market scenes of duck eggs "balut" vendors, fruit and vegetable sellers, and "sabungeros".

        <div class="desc-right">This wondrous rendition of a rural landscape, possibly view of Binangonan, Rizal, combines the artist’s folk romanticism, with its lyrical colors and archetypes, and Manansala’s postwar modernism. This style is characterized by semi-figurative transparent cubism where forms are not simply fragmented for the sake of formalism, but rather rendered as sensuous facets that overlap, conveying the textures and rhythms of this idyllic environment.

        <div class="desc-left">In 1949, UNESCO awarded Manansala with a six-month grant to study at the École de Beaux Arts in Banff and Montreal, Canada. By this time he had won the first prize at the National Art Exhibition, University of Santo Tomas (1941) and had completed several major works, such as Banaklaot (1948).

        <div class="name-right">Still Life With Fish</div>
        <div class="desc-right">The primary goal of the postwar Philippine modernists, collectively referred to by art historians as the Neo-Realists, was to explore how the formal elements of art, namely: line, shape, form, tone, texture, pattern and colour interrelated. The resulting compositions drawn from reality were brought together to produce an aesthetic response from viewers.

            This is the concept that lies at the core of this still-life by National Artist Vicente Manansala, who brings together disparate objects - bottles, cups, fruits, fish - and arranges these to create a picture of balance and movement through the cyclical direction of the various forms leading the observer's eye. The use of strong, primary color glossy enamel paint, and the application of tin strips to create texture, all combine to produce a vision of plenitude, a table of bounty that viewers can feast on.

        <div class="name-left">Candle Vendors</div>
        <div class="desc-left">A stunning specimen of Manansala’s transparent cubism, Candle Vendors defies all concepts of spatial dimension through the eyes of the spectator. In the foreground, three candlestick vendors are grouped together, line of sight angled above them as the viewer looks down at the candles resting on braided baskets. But as the eye follows the gaze of the rightmost vendor, a checkered path slopes upward in the far left, leading the observer towards an enigmatic darkness, adding intrigue to an already stimulating pièce de résistance.

            The painting was acquired from the previous owner directly from the artist. It was exhibited in a gallery called Showroom in the late 1970s which was near the Plaza Restaurant in Goldcrest Arcade. It is accompanied by a receipt signed by the artist.
