        <div class="desc-artist">Pacita Abad is renowned for her eccentric use of color in her paintings. Some other unique features of her paintings included underwater scenes, along with wild animals and tropical flowers. She managed to highlight the constant changes and developments going on in the world around her. Her paintings are a reflection of her travels all over the world. After briefly studying painting in New York and Washington D.C., she went on to travel over 80 countries around the world. Her travels and her experiences with different people and cultures from various parts of the world had a major influence on her style of painting. In 1970s and 1980s, her work was majorly inspired by painters like Ben Shahn, which led her to create paintings which inspired political and social thought. Abad received several awards during her lifetime. In 1984, she became the first woman to win the Ten Outstanding Young Men (TOYM) Award. Additionally, she also won the D.C. Commission on the Arts Award in 1989 and 1990 and the Gwendolyn Caffritz Award in 1992.</div>

        <div class="desc-left">My hope is that when people look at the fifty-five colors and playful circle designs adorning the Bridge, they will smile and enjoy experiencing art as a part of their daily life. The "Painted Bridge" is my gift to the people of Singapore !
               <br> I believe that art should be for everyone, and that is why I am so happy that each day thousands of Singaporeans and international tourists pass over, by, and under the Bridge by foot, bicycle, car, bus and boat. It delights me that many people have been attracted and enchanted by the Bridge's colorful design. I am even more pleased by the number of people that have brought their families down to Robertson Quay just to take a look at the "Painted Bridge". For me, it is very rewarding just to see the happy smiles on the children's faces as they cross over the "Painted Bridge".

        <div class="desc-left">One of the cruelest ironies in the plight of the refugees, is that even though they have reached a camp they are not safe. As the internecine fighting in Camp 204 near Ban Non Mak Moon has illustrated, the senseless savagery lingers. Mortars, guns and blood, the refugees who have been through so much in the past still suffer.

        <div class="desc-right">As the UNHCR water trucks approach the camp, the Kampuchean children rush to fill their plastic pails with water. I was particularly touched, when at the corner, I saw this woman giving her son a drink from a bowl of water, while her other two sons anxiously waited their turn.
