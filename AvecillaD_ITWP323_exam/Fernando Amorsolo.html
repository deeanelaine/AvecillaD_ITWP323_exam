        <div class="desc-artist">Fernando Amorsolo y Cueto (May 30, 1892 – April 24, 1972) was a portraitist and painter of rural Philippine landscapes. Nicknamed the "Grand Old Man of Philippine Art," he was the first-ever to be recognized as a National Artist of the Philippines.
            <br><br>He was recognized as such for his "pioneering use of impressionistic technique" as well as his skill in the use of lighting and backlighting in his paintings, "significant not only in the development of Philippine art but also in the formation of Filipino notions of self and identity."

        <div class="desc-left">This 1921 oil painting by Fernando Amorsolo (Roa 1992, 97) is the earliest known version of a series of works, also titled Planting Rice, done by Amorsolo from 1921 to 1944. Another larger version, also titled Planting Rice and dated 1924, is in the Paulino and Hetty Que collection (Cruz 2008, 96-7). Both paintings share almost the same composition. The scene is set in a wet rice field with shallow pilapil (rice paddy) hedges forming orthogonal patterns rising toward the left horizon line. The field is populated by three groups of farmers.

        <div class="desc-right">Amorsolo painted the Philippine landscape in sunny and colorful depictions that idealized both nature and native beauty. Using techniques of natural outdoor lighting and taking from the Impressionists of Europe, he mastered the skill of natural lighting in his paintings, and this trademark was later called his mastery of the “Philippine Sun.”

        <div class="desc-left">the painting consists of Filipino fruit harvesters. There are six of them - two at the left back side and four at right front. There is also a big mango tree in front and different sizes of baskets for the mangoes. One person, who has her back turned seems to be talking to the girl sitting. Others were totally engrossed to their work. The place is very bright as a green environment.
            <br>The artwork has a smooth texture, bright colors were often used than the dark ones. There were a lot of curved lines and very few straight lines. Also, the intensity of the painting is low due to light colors. It is not balanced: the right side has more weight than the left. Here, no spaces can be seen, everything has been filled and for that, there was no dull moment.

          <div class="desc-left">“The women I paint should have a rounded face, not of the oval type often presented to us in newspapers and magazine illustrations. The eyes should be exceptionally lively, not the dreamy, sleepy type that characterizes the Mongolian. The nose should be of the blunt form but firm and strongly marked. …
            <br><br>So the ideal Filipina beauty should not necessarily be white complexioned, nor of the dark brown color of the typical Malayan, but of the clear skin or fresh colored type which we often witness when we met a blushing girl.”
