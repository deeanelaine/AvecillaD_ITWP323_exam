        <div class="desc-artist">Juan Luna de San Pedro y Novicio Ancheta (Spanish: [ˈxwan ˈluna], Tagalog: [hwɐn ˈluna]; October 23, 1857 – December 7, 1899) was a Filipino painter, sculptor and a political activist of the Philippine Revolution during the late 19th century. He became one of the first recognized Philippine artists.
          <br><br>His winning the gold medal in the 1884 Madrid Exposition of Fine Arts, along with the silver win of fellow Filipino painter Félix Resurrección Hidalgo, prompted a celebration which was a major highlight in the memoirs of members of the Propaganda Movement, with the fellow Ilustrados toasting to the two painters' good health and to the brotherhood between Spain and the Philippines.
          <br><br>Well regarded for work done in the manner of European academies of his time, Luna painted literary and historical scenes, some with an underscore of political commentary. His allegorical works were inspired with classical balance, and often showed figures in theatrical poses.</div>

The painting was submitted by Luna to the Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes in 1884 in Madrid, where it garnered the first gold medal (out of three). The picture recreates a despoiling scene in a Roman circus where dead gladiators are stripped of weapons and garments. Together with other works of the Spanish Academy, the Spoliarium was on exhibit in Rome in April 1884.

        <div class="name-left">Odalisque</div>
        <div class="desc-left">The Odalisque is a famous 1885 painting by award-winning Filipino painter and revolutionary activist Juan Luna. It is one of Luna's so-called "Academic Salon portraits" that followed the standards of proper proportion and perspective, and realistic depictions with "an air of dignity and allure". Although less polished compared to Luna's other works of art, the Odalisque is typical of the well-planned characteristic of the artist's portraits, meaning it was painted in a personal studio while expertly studying the desired effects, and with finesse. The Odalisque is one of the paintings that made Luna as an officially accepted artist at the Salon of Paris because it shows Luna's skill at draftsmanship, his "talent to draw and to draw well". The Odalisque was formerly a part of the painting collection of Philippine national hero José Rizal. It is currently a component of the Don Luis Araneta Collection in the Philippines.
