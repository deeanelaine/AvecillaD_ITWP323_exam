        <div class="desc-left">In Philippine contemporary art, the name Imelda Cajipe-Endaya is at the forefront of feminism. Wrote eminent critic Alice Guillermo: “She has focused on the plight of the Filipina in her various contemporary roles in a feminism that is articulated with the quest for national liberation… Most remarkable is her use of indigenous materials and folk symbolic elements to convey local textures and colors along with their rich social and historical connotations.”...
            Endaya’s “Happy Mother’s Day, Tandang Sora” is a poem to Melchora Aquino, revered in our history as the Mother of the Katipunan, who ministered to sick and wounded revolutionaries. “Portrait of the Artist as Babaylan” is a self-portrait rendition of the artist in a drama-ritual that conflates the roles of healer, shaman and creator.
