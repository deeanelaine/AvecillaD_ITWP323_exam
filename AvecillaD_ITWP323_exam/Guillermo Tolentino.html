        <div class="desc-left">Here is a plaster sculpture of a standing young woman with a small girl next to her. On the hexagonal base the word "PAX" is inscribed. This statue was sculpted by Philipino sculptor Guillermo Tolentino in 1919. It was inspired by Wilson's efforts at achieving peace at the conclusion of World War I. The statue was well liked by Wilson who thought it represented "a picture of America leading the way of salvation for the smaller nations of the world." Toletino was a waiter who met Mrs. Wilson at a tea room in Rock Creek Park, which led to an audience with the president, wherein Toldetino brought the sculpture to the White House.
