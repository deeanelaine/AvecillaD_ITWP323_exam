        <div class="desc-artist">Victorio Candido Edades (December 23, 1895 – March 7, 1985) was a Filipino painter. He led the revolutionary Thirteen Moderns, who engaged their classical compatriots in heated debate over the nature and function of art. He was named a National Artist in 1976. The history names Victorio Edades as “the father of Modern Philippine art".
            <br><br> Schooled in the US upon his return he introduced an entirely new way of thinking about art. He argued that art can be more than representation of reality, it can be representation of reality as seen through the mind and emotions of the artist.

        <div class="desc-left">In 1922 the travelling exhibit of the Armory show opened his eyes and that of the American public to the artistic ferment in Europe led by Cezanne, Gauguin, Matisse, Picasso’, Duchamp, the surrealists, and the Dadaists. While it drew outcries from the conservative public, it gave Edades the artistic direction he was looking for. Deviating from the academic style, while retaining some of its characteristics, he executed two paintings in 1928: “The Sketch,” (also called “The Artist and His Model”) and “The Builders.”

        <div class="desc-right">The Builders was one of Edades's major works exhibited at his 1928 one-man show. Here the subject was far removed from Amorsolo's images of the countryside. Shown is a group of builders working to construct an edifice. The setting is not specific; neither do the builders have individualizing features.

          <div class="desc-right">Poinsettia Girl has become one of Edades’ most iconic works: It has been documented in multiple works and was the star of the ‘Edades in Retrospect” at the Museum of Philippine Art in 1980. It features an unsmiling woman who is however festooned, impervious, to the flowers of Christmas, also known as the pascua, that surround her. The intense ruby color is repeated in her frock and maquillage. The poinsettia, which came to the Philippines like Edades from across the seas, is originally from Mexico and traveled here on the Manila galleons. The legend goes that it was an offering of a poor boy to the Child Jesus on Christmas day, not finding a suitable gift, he cut a branch of a plant on his way to church. As he laid it at the feet of the Child, the plant’s leaves turned bright red, the stars twinkled and lit up the entire village. The same can be said for Edades’ gift to Philippine modern art.
